## **如何在比特币区块链上使用bitdb 2.0 建一个网站。**

> 据Bitcoin消息，近日，BCH爱好者Donald Mulders在社交媒体网络Yours.org上发表文章，详细描述了他试图利用Bitdb 2.0应用程序在BCH链上建立一个网站。之后在BCH开发者Unwriter和一个名为“Cryptograffitiweb”的工具的帮助下，Mulders的链上网站“Bitcoin Cash Hoarder”现在可以在任何浏览器上看到。Mulders表示：“如果有人能在不需要像维基解密这样的组织的情况下发布敏感信息，那么任何人都可以匿名发布信息，而不会危及自己或任何中间人。”据悉，Bitdb 2.0是一个平台，可接受比特币交易并将其放入结构化的可读文档或者在Donald Mulders此次使用的HTML代码中。（[中文来源：币世界](http://www.bishijie.com/kuaixun_118500)）（英文来源 [bitcoin news: Launching a Website on the Bitcoin Cash Network Is Now a Reality](https://news.bitcoin.com/)）

按：这篇文章翻译的就是这位在yours上发的文章来源：[Hosting a website on the BCH blockchain with bitdb 2.0. I am close but no sigar.](https://www.yours.org/content/hosting-a-website-on-the-bch-blockchain-with-bitdb-20----------i-am-5b8346293439)由于口水话太多，没有逐一翻译。

I can do a little HTML and I can mess around a littble bit in existing code I take from others. I am just starting to learn and had only about 2 lessons so far. With a lot of trial and error, I can make a simple website, but that's about it. I still have a long long way to go in mastering the art of programming. But I am taking baby steps towards this goal. Inspired by the BitDB 2.0 from [Unwriter](https://www.yours.org/@unwriter) (<https://www.yours.org/content/introducing-bitdb-20-e8c17c845939>) I just started working on a idea, but needless to say for now I am way over my head. 

作者说自己会一点html，编程属于初学者，然后在bitdb2.0 的启发下，动手做了一个简单的网站。

Anyway I started playing around with an idea to see how far I could take it. The idea is to host a simple HTML website on the bitcoin cash blockchain that easily could be viewed in a browser. In such a way that even my own mother is able to view it as if it was just an ordinairy website. Is there a use case? Does this even need blockchain? Well imagine if someone could publish sensitive information without the need for organisation’s such as WikiLeaks, readable as a ordinairy website for anyone in the world. This way anyone could publish information anonymous without endangering themselfs or any middleman. People like Julian Assange are hard to find nowadays, and I do not expect that there are many people who dare to take on such a role in the future. Freedom of expression, freedom of information, free journalism and a secure way to publish information for whistleblowers. This is the use case.

作者打算在区块链上建一个简单的可以通过浏览器访问的html网站，这样即使是他妈妈也会以为这是一个普通的网站，这样有个好处，人们可以匿名发布一些敏感信息而不用通过维基泄密那样的组织，同时免于可能的危险。

 ==（！这里的原理没有说明，为什么可以匿名，以及可以做到多大程度上的匿名。）==

To see how far I could take this idea I made a very simple website in HTML and I included a snake game in JavaScript just to see if it would work. Lean and mean. This is how the site would look like. 

作者在网页里用JavaScript写了一个贪吃蛇游戏。

Yes it is just snake but I renamed it Bitcoin Cash Hoarder, because it sound way cooler, and made it green and orange. I used [https://www.cryptograffiti.info](https://www.mttr.app/) to upload the code to the blockchain. This is easy as pie.

作者用[https://www.cryptograffiti.info](https://www.mttr.app/)上传代码到区块链

 The best way to explain what happens is that just like with [https://memo.cash](https://simpleledger.cash/), you make a OpReturn transaction where text is inserted, but since my text does not fit into a single transaction, it creates many transactions a bit similar to [https://www.scale.cash](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/memo%2B%2B/efbehadlmgmkdflmmfjnadbnfamloeie) (the stress test tool) and it inserts small pieces of text with each transaction until it is finished. 

就像使用[https://memo.cash](https://simpleledger.cash/)（memo是一个基于区块链的活动资金筹集工具）一样，你使用了一个opreturn 交易，在文本被插入的地方，但由于我的文本没有适合一个单笔交易，所以他创造了许多交易，这有点像[https://www.scale.cash](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/memo%2B%2B/efbehadlmgmkdflmmfjnadbnfamloeie)（压力测试工具），在完成前它在每一笔交易中插入了文本的小片段。

Here you can see my transaction on a bitcoin cash explorer: <https://explorer.bitcoin.com/bch/tx/fa69fb53bb45cd9df375f93f6cca52d044e4505eda5ce1b9504ae2c6a999ae27> 

 

你可以在比特币浏览器上看到我的交易记录。

The HTML code is now stored on the blockchain. 

现在Html 代码已经被储存在区块链上。

Step 1 is easy, anyone could do this. But how can I extract this information from the blockchain and display it as a website. I hoped bitdb could help me with this problem. If you go to the bitdb explorer ([https://bitdb.network/explorer](http://www.memopay.xyz/)) anyone should be able to extract the HTML code form the blockchain. 

第一步，如果你使用bitdb浏览器([https://bitdb.network/explorer](http://www.memopay.xyz/))，就可以从区块链中提取html代码。

This is the promise. As instructed on the bitdb website I used some standard code available and included the correct bitcoin cash address. This is the code I used for the query:

照着bitdb网站上给的指导，我用了一些标准代码，其中包括正确的比特币地址。下面是我查询时用的代码

```
{ "v": 2, 

"q": 

{ "find": {

 "in.e.a": "qqfse6sldawf742ydclj2n2uwgy7pxnd4ctlnph68a" 

}, 

"limit": 10 

}

 }
```

 

When you paste this code in the bitdb explorer and run the query you are able to find my HTML code. Just look at “out” & “s2” and follow every box below. There it is. 

当你把代码粘贴到bitdb浏览器并运行查询，你就能够看到我的html代码。在out和s2里，如下

![](E:\git_project\blockchain\assets\img\HTML_code.jpg)

But this is not even near being a website. Whatever I tried, I was not able to make the HTML more readable, let alone, display it in a browser. Just to say it again, I am a noob and lacking such skills.

但这还不能叫做一个网站，不管我怎么试，我也不能是html更具可读性。因为我只是一个初学者。

 I did look into GitHub to see if the code of sites like memo and matter could help me out but I couldn’t make enough sense of it to replicate such a activity. 

我在GitHub上找了找看看有没有和我网站的代码相似的，但没找到。

I should actually should start with lesson 3 and 4 of my HTML course because I am stuck. Step 2 is a lot harder for me.

我应该开始进一步学习一下html课程。第二步有点难对于我来说。

But not giving up yet and looking for a workaround. I went back to [cryptograffiti.info](https://t.me/joinchat/HH1DDQ8pZlSlsdNcKgIcxw) to see if I could extract my code from the blockchain here. 

但还没有放弃。我又回到[cryptograffiti.info](https://t.me/joinchat/HH1DDQ8pZlSlsdNcKgIcxw)去看我是否能从区块链上提取我的代码。

 

As you can see on this website it shows many text messages. Your text could become hard to find over time as new messages are posted. 

 

正如你在这个网站上看到的，它展示了很多的文本信息。随着新信息不断发布出现，你的文本会难以被找到。

 

I also looked on GitHub for the code of cryptograffiti and after reading some instruction, I figured out a simple hack. 



我在GitHub上看了下cryptograffiti的代码，阅读了一些说明后，我想到了一个简单的hack。

Just put a # behind the URL and include the transaction ID of the original message. When you do this the website will only display your message. In my case that would be <https://www.cryptograffiti.info/#fa69fb53bb45cd9df375f93f6cca52d044e4505eda5ce1b9504ae2c6a999ae27> 

在URL后面加一个#，并包含原始信息的交易ID，这样网站就仅仅展示你的信息。比如我的例子是这样：<https://www.cryptograffiti.info/#fa69fb53bb45cd9df375f93f6cca52d044e4505eda5ce1b9504ae2c6a999ae27> ![](E:\git_project\blockchain\assets\img\graf.png)



Ok, there is my HTML code again and readable for the human eye. Still not a website but this is something. Now what? In a perfect world I would be able to find a piece of code online that would enable me to grab the message from this website and display's my HTML text as a website. I tried but I could not find any. It probably does exist but I did not find it. 

Al that I can do for now to make my HTML code visable as website is to copy paste it in a document and store it as HTML file on my computer. If you open the file in a browser it does show the website as intented. As I made the code myself I know I can trust it. But this might not be the case for others. The safer way is to use a HTML test site. This way it is less likely you would accidently install some virus on your computer. Check out <http://www.play-hookey.com/htmltest/> or <https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_intro>. Just copy past the code from [www.cryptograffiti.info](http://www.cryptograffiti.info/), place it into a html test side and there is my website for you all to see. It works, and even my Bitcoin Cash Hoarder game works.

作者说，你可以把从 [www.cryptograffiti.info](http://www.cryptograffiti.info/)复制的代码，拿到 <http://www.play-hookey.com/htmltest/> or <https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_intro>.测试。

But this is still far too difficult for my mother to do. Soo……. who has the skills to help me with some code that enables me to skip some steps in this proces to make it noob proof. It should be possible for shure because [www.cryptograffiti.info](https://memo.cash/protocol) or BitDB is able to extract such info from the blockchain and any online HTML tester is able to display it as a website. The underlying code should be available to make this work. Myself I just lack the skills. 



最后作者说，要进一步的学习努力balabalabala.....

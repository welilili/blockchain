据Bitcoin消息，近日，BCH爱好者Donald Mulders在社交媒体网络Yours.org上发表文章，详细描述了他试图利用Bitdb 2.0应用程序在BCH链上建立一个网站。<!-- more -->
之后在BCH开发者Unwriter和一个名为“Cryptograffitiweb”的工具的帮助下，Mulders的链上网站“Bitcoin Cash Hoarder”现在可以在任何浏览器上看到。Mulders表示：“如果有人能在不需要像维基解密这样的组织的情况下发布敏感信息，那么任何人都可以匿名发布信息，而不会危及自己或任何中间人。”据悉，Bitdb 2.0是一个平台，可接受比特币交易并将其放入结构化的可读文档或者在Donald Mulders此次使用的HTML代码中。

I am close but no sigar.](https://www.yours.org/content/hosting-a-website-on-the-bch-blockchain-with-bitdb-20----------i-am-5b8346293439)由于口水话太多，没有逐一翻译。![](E:\git_project\blockchain\assets\img\HTML_code.jpg)

I can do a little HTML and I can mess around a littble bit in existing code I take from others. I am just starting to learn and had only about 2 lessons so far. With a lot of trial and error, I can make a simple website, but that's about it. I still have a long long way to go in mastering the art of programming. But I am taking baby steps towards this goal. Inspired by the BitDB 2.0 from [Unwriter](https://www.yours.org/@unwriter) (<https://www.yours.org/content/introducing-bitdb-20-e8c17c845939>) I just started working on a idea, but needless to say for now I am way over my head. 

作者说自己会一点html，编程属于初学者，然后在bitdb2.0 的启发下，动手做了一个简单的网站。

Anyway I started playing around with an idea to see how far I could take it. The idea is to host a simple HTML website on the bitcoin cash blockchain that easily could be viewed in a browser. In such a way that even my own mother is able to view it as if it was just an ordinairy website. Is there a use case? Does this even need blockchain? Well imagine if someone could publish sensitive information without the need for organisation’s such as WikiLeaks, readable as a ordinairy website for anyone in the world. This way anyone could publish information anonymous without endangering themselfs or any middleman. People like Julian Assange are hard to find nowadays, and I do not expect that there are many people who dare to take on such a role in the future. Freedom of expression, freedom of information, free journalism and a secure way to publish information for whistleblowers. This is the use case.

作者打算在区块链上建一个简单的可以通过浏览器访问的html网站，这样即使是他妈妈也会以为这是一个普通的网站，这样有个好处，人们可以匿名发布一些敏感信息而不用通过维基泄密那样的组织。

【这里的原理没有说明，为什么可以匿名，以及可以做到多大程度上的匿名。】

，同时免于可能的危险。

To see how far I could take this idea I made a very simple website in HTML and I included a snake game in JavaScript just to see if it would work. Lean and mean. This is how the site would look like. 

作者在网页里用JavaScript写了一个贪吃蛇游戏。

Yes it is just snake but I renamed it Bitcoin Cash Hoarder, because it sound way cooler, and made it green and orange. I used [https://www.cryptograffiti.info](https://www.mttr.app/) to upload the code to the blockchain. This is easy as pie.

作者用[https://www.cryptograffiti.info](https://www.mttr.app/)上传代码到区块链

 The best way to explain what happens is that just like with [https://memo.cash](https://simpleledger.cash/), you make a OpReturn transaction where text is inserted, but since my text does not fit into a single transaction, it creates many transactions a bit similar to [https://www.scale.cash](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/memo%2B%2B/efbehadlmgmkdflmmfjnadbnfamloeie) (the stress test tool) and it inserts small pieces of text with each transaction until it is finished. 

就像使用[https://memo.cash](https://simpleledger.cash/)（memo是一个基于区块链的活动资金筹集工具）一样，你使用了一个opreturn 交易，在文本被插入的地方，但由于我的文本没有适合一个单笔交易，所以他创造了许多交易，这有点像[https://www.scale.cash](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/memo%2B%2B/efbehadlmgmkdflmmfjnadbnfamloeie)（压力测试工具），在完成前它在每一笔交易中插入了文本的小片段。

Here you can see my transaction on a bitcoin cash explorer: <https://explorer.bitcoin.com/bch/tx/fa69fb53bb45cd9df375f93f6cca52d044e4505eda5ce1b9504ae2c6a999ae27> 

 

你可以在比特币浏览器上看到我的交易记录。

The HTML code is now stored on the blockchain. 

现在Html 代码已经被储存在区块链上。

Step 1 is easy, anyone could do this. But how can I extract this information from the blockchain and display it as a website. I hoped bitdb could help me with this problem. If you go to the bitdb explorer ([https://bitdb.network/explorer](http://www.memopay.xyz/)) anyone should be able to extract the HTML code form the blockchain. 

第一步，如果你使用bitdb浏览器([https://bitdb.network/explorer](http://www.memopay.xyz/))，就可以从区块链中提取html代码。

This is the promise. As instructed on the bitdb website I used some standard code available and included the correct bitcoin cash address. This is the code I used for the query:

照着bitdb网站上给的指导，我用了一些标准代码，其中包括正确的比特币地址。下面是我查询时用的代码

```
{ "v": 2, 

"q": 

{ "find": {

 "in.e.a": "qqfse6sldawf742ydclj2n2uwgy7pxnd4ctlnph68a" 

}, 

"limit": 10 

}

 }
```

 

When you paste this code in the bitdb explorer and run the query you are able to find my HTML code. Just look at “out” & “s2” and follow every box below. There it is. 

当你把代码粘贴到bitdb浏览器并运行查询，你就能够看到我的html代码。在out和s2里，如下

![](E:\git_project\blockchain\assets\img\HTML_code.jpg)

But this is not even near being a website. Whatever I tried, I was not able to make the HTML more readable, let alone, display it in a browser. Just to say it again, I am a noob and lacking such skills.

但这还不能叫做一个网站，不管我怎么试，我也不能是html更具可读性。因为我只是一个初学者。

 I did look into GitHub to see if the code of sites like memo and matter could help me out but I couldn’t make enough sense of it to replicate such a activity. 

我在GitHub上找了找看看有没有和我网站的代码相似的，但没找到。

I should actually should start with lesson 3 and 4 of my HTML course because I am stuck. Step 2 is a lot harder for me.

我应该开始进一步学习一下html课程。第二步有点难对于我来说。

But not giving up yet and looking for a workaround. I went back to [cryptograffiti.info](https://t.me/joinchat/HH1DDQ8pZlSlsdNcKgIcxw) to see if I could extract my code from the blockchain here. 

但还没有放弃。我又回到[cryptograffiti.info](https://t.me/joinchat/HH1DDQ8pZlSlsdNcKgIcxw)去看我是否能从区块链上提取我的代码。

 

As you can see on this website it shows many text messages. Your text could become hard to find over time as new messages are posted. 

 

正如你在这个网站上看到的，它展示了很多的文本信息。随着新信息不断发布出现，你的文本会难以被找到。

 

I also looked on GitHub for the code of cryptograffiti and after reading some instruction, I figured out a simple hack.
